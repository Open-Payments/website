The Message Processor is the core engine of the Open Payments platform, serving as the central nervous system that orchestrates payment transactions seamlessly from initiation to completion. It streamlines the flow of financial messages through a robust, security-first architecture. Each message passing through the system is:

* **Enriched**: Adds necessary information such as customer verification data and compliance checks, including OFAC screening and AML validations
* **Validated**: Confirms accuracy and compliance with regulatory and business rules, including Regulation guidelines
* **Transformed**: Adjusts message formats to meet internal or external standards, supporting ISO 20022, SWIFT, and proprietary formats
* **Routed**: Directs messages to appropriate systems or networks based on configurable workflows

By efficiently handling inbound messages, applying necessary transformations, and directing them to designated outbound channels, the Message Processor enables seamless integration with a bank's existing systems. Its support for complex, multi-step workflows allows it to adapt to diverse payment formats and regulatory requirements, enhancing interoperability and operational efficiency.
